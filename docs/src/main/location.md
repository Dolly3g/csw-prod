# Location service

Location Service handles component (i.e., Applications, Sequencers, Assemblies, HCDs, and Services) registration and discovery in the distributed TMT software system. A componentâ€™s location information can be utilized by other component/service to connect or use it. Example of location information is
 
* host address/port pairs
* URL/URIs
* connection protocols

## API Usage Examples

### Register a component

An Application, Sequencer, Assembly, HCD, or Service component may need to be used by another component as part of normal operations. It must register its location information with Location service so that other components can find it.
